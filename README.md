  <h3>
    What is Tree ?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A tree data structure is a hierarchical collection of nodes that starts with a root node and branches out to other nodes, forming a tree-like structure. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can have its own children. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems, organization charts, and hierarchical data in databases. Trees are also commonly used in computer science algorithms, particularly in graph algorithms and search algorithms.

  <ol>
  <li> File Systems: Trees are used to represent the hierarchical structure of files and directories in operating systems.</li>

<li>Databases: Trees are used in databases to organize and retrieve data efficiently, such as in indexing structures like B-trees and binary search trees.</li>

<li>Networking: Trees are used in networking protocols like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for ensuring a loop-free topology in network connections.</li>

<li>Artificial Intelligence: Trees are used in decision tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.</li>

<li>Compiler Design: Trees are used in parsing algorithms like Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to represent the structure of source code.</li>

<li>Game Development: Trees are used in game development for various purposes, such as representing game state, AI decision-making, and rendering scene graphs.</li>

<li>Data Compression: Trees are used in data compression algorithms like Huffman coding to efficiently encode and decode data.</li>

  ## Types Of Trees We Have ->


  There are several types of tree data structures, each with its own characteristics and uses. Here are some common types of tree data structures:
  <hr>
1. **Binary Tree:** A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This is a simple and widely used type of tree.

<hr>
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of each left child is less than the value of its parent node, and the value of each right child is greater than the value of its parent node. This property makes binary search trees useful for searching and sorting operations.

<hr>
3. **AVL Tree:** An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing property ensures that the tree remains balanced and maintains a logarithmic height for efficient operations.

<hr>
4. **Red-Black Tree:** A red-black tree is another type of self-balancing binary search tree in which each node is colored red or black. The tree is balanced using specific rules for coloring and rotations, ensuring that the tree remains balanced and maintains a logarithmic height.

5. **B-Tree:** A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems.

<hr>
6. **Trie:** A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings. Each node in the trie represents a common prefix of its descendants, and the root is an empty string. Tries are efficient for searching for strings with a common prefix.

These are just a few examples of tree data structures, each with its own unique properties and applications.
