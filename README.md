  <h3>
    What is Tree ?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A tree data structure is a hierarchical collection of nodes that starts with a root node and branches out to other nodes, forming a tree-like structure. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can have its own children. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems, organization charts, and hierarchical data in databases. Trees are also commonly used in computer science algorithms, particularly in graph algorithms and search algorithms.

  <h3>
  Where does it actually used ?
  </h3>
  <ol>
  <li> File Systems: Trees are used to represent the hierarchical structure of files and directories in operating systems.</li>

<li>Databases: Trees are used in databases to organize and retrieve data efficiently, such as in indexing structures like B-trees and binary search trees.</li>

<li>Networking: Trees are used in networking protocols like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for ensuring a loop-free topology in network connections.</li>

<li>Artificial Intelligence: Trees are used in decision tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.</li>

<li>Compiler Design: Trees are used in parsing algorithms like Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to represent the structure of source code.</li>

<li>Game Development: Trees are used in game development for various purposes, such as representing game state, AI decision-making, and rendering scene graphs.</li>

<li>Data Compression: Trees are used in data compression algorithms like Huffman coding to efficiently encode and decode data.</li>
